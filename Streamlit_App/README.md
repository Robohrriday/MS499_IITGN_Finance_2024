**Note**: If the Streamlit app does not work, it might be due to unresolved dependency issues or errors from the server side. In that case, you may try running the `ReportGenerator.ipynb` jupyter notebook (this solves the server side problems, but still not guaranteeing dependency issues with `yfinance` library).
